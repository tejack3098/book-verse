    # # Machine Learning Models (On Goodreads Dataset)

    # # Item Based Collaborative Filtering

    # ## Creating The Books - User Matrix

    # For this we must convert the data frame that we have such that each user will be denoted by the rows and the books will be denoted by the columns, and each userâ€™s rating of the book will be the data in this matrix. We can convert our data frame to this matrix by using pivot table concept as shown below:

    cf_matrix = good_reads_reviews_100_df.pivot_table(index='book_id', columns='user_id', values='rating')

    # print("cf_matrix:")
    # cf_matrix.info()


    # ## Problems with Computing Similarity Immediately
    # If we directly use the cosine similarity from this matrix, it will not be very useful, because the models will think that a rating of 2/5 and 4/5 are very close to each other. However, in reality the rating 2 denotes that the book was not very good (negative rating), and rating 4 denotes that a book is very good (positive rating). One way that we can combat this problem is that we can perform mean centering based on average rating of the books.
    # ### Mean Center Users

    matrix_mean_center = cf_matrix.subtract(cf_matrix.mean(axis=1), axis = 0)
    # matrix_mean_center


    # ## Pearson Correlation

    # Finding the user - user similarity matrix using Pearson correlation
    book_similarity = matrix_mean_center.T.corr()
    # book_similarity.head()

# # Conclusion
# From these set of experiments, we can see that the cosine similarity was indeed able to recommend similar books. The first content-based filtering approach were more focused on the content rather that the type of books users read. The row highlighted above using the count vectorizer with k = 20 having precision - 0.111, recall â€“ 0.1 and f1-score 0.105 was the best among the rest.
# <br>
# 
# However, this was not a good metric to use to understand how the performance of the models were. In the below table we can see that the highest similarity score of the different models while recommendation
# 
# Finally, we can see that the advanced Doc2Vec model had the highest similarity score for the book recommendations from 89.5% to 78.4%.
